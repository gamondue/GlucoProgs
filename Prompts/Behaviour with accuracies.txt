The MealPage is not working properly in its two parts relating to accuracy. Both parts should be operated in the following way: when choosing an accuracy from the comboBox the numerical value of the accuracy has to be set with the numerical value associated to the value chosen accuracy in the combo. When the user finishes his writing in the numerical value of accuracy, the program must choose in the combo the right value (a method in the Business Layer is already present to evaluate the value of the accuracy enumerator to be set). Currently the updating of accuracies is not working at all. In the previous iteration (git last commit) it was working only when choosing the value from the combo, not when directly writing the accuracies in the numerical entry. Please refactor the code such to make it work like specified.
