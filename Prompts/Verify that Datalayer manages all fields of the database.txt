Based on the SQLite database whose creation you find in the string "creationScript" in file "Sqlite_DataLayerConstructorsAndGeneral.cs", verify that all the fields of all the tables of the database are correctly written and read by DataLayer methods, in the implementation for SQLite. 
If some fields are not managed, in writing nor reading, then signal the name of the fields to me.
